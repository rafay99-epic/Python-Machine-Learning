It was good to see proud white British people celebrate our lads , the crowd was all white , i wouldve gone if id known it was happening , the traffic was bad today , ill bet thatll be why proud white British people celebrate 2nd Signal Regiment Malton and Pickering Mercury - `` Throng welcomes soldiers at parade '' 104.7 Minster FM - `` 300 soldiers welcomed home in York '' Darlington and Stockton Times - `` 2 Signal Regiment march through York following return from Afghanistan '' Obviously there was sorrow for Lee Rigby and his family , we are outraged and very angry at what happened to him
