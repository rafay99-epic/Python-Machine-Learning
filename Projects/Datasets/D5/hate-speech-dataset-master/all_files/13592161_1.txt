Black metal fan , eyh ? = o ) The fight against god and christ has begun Forever we will remember those that lived under the hammer of our hoards Forever is the war against those of the light , untill they meet the face of death , the cold of death A winter of cold shall come to freese the blood of the christians Our crusade has begun and every step is a stake through christs heart We burn gods children on the bonfire We burn the house of god The age of darkness shall cover the sun The gate of pearls will be crushed And each thorn in his skull , every nail in his body Souls born under the mighty throne of death We march our deathskull rally to the land of death and endless plains When the crusaders dangle , and the spirit of christ is dead When the moon shines pale and lonely , the sounds of a death march will be heard Gone were those of gods earth , behind a dark cloud , the moon so crude and col Song is the last note of a grave song
