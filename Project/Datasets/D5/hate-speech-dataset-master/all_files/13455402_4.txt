I 'm not saying `` do n't go out of your house and do n't talk to anyone '' but it 's really important to stay grounded with a group who are n't part of the mass. It 's much easier to remain independent and avoid being caught under the stampede if you have a reminder that you are n't the only person who 's not part of the mass. Uuuugh !
