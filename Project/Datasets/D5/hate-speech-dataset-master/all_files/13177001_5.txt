I also attended a Masters/PhD graduation ceremony at a major state university a few years ago - none of the CS degrees were awarded to blacks. [ a couple computer degrees went to blacks , but they were in IT with a focus on internet marketing/web-commerce ] So where are all these black computer geniuses hiding ?
